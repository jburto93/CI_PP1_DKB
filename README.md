## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to look modern and stylish while keeping the site simple to naviagte for the customer, the design replicates the companies sleek kitchen and bathroom designs they offer. 

### Colour
The monochromatic colour scheme of black, white and different shades of grey was chosen to give a modern look to the webpage. The darker colouring also allows the images of the companies installed work really stand out. When choosing the site colours I used Adobe Color to confirm the contrast between the colours was right.

### Fonts
The heading font chosen for throughout the site is anek telugu from Google Fonts, the reasons I chose this font is because it is very clear and easy to read. The chosen font also has a stylish modern look which links in with the design of the webpage. As a back up I chose sans-serif if the anek telugu is unavailable.

### Structure
The webpage has been structured in a familiar and accessible way. Once the user has reached the site they will instantly see the company name/logo in the top left corner and the navitgation menu in the top right corner, this is common throughout the site to keep the site easily operated by the user. The site is made up of four pages:
- Homepage has two sections, firstly a brief introduction to the company and secondly reasons why to choose the company.
- Our Services outlines the servies the company offer.
- Gallery shows the user an image gallery of all recent work completed by the company.
- Contact Us provides all contact information for the company and a form allowing the user to contact the company.
